## Work Experience
**Infrastructure Engineer and System Administrator @ ATOS (_November 2022 - Present_)**
- **GDC (global data center)**
At the beginning I joined ATOS 3 months academy (paid) with Romanian Instructors and after the 
evaluation I got assigned to a project for French customer with a Romanian team where I’m 
responsible for monitoring and maintaining a different kinds of systems and servers like (Unix, 
Windows, Linux, ESX datacenters) and also Control-M Application for job monitoring software 
and that was with limited access till I got assigned to shifts after second evaluation where I’m 
working on Service NOW ticketing system as before but with less limited access where I can 
resolve most of the tickets as per documentation as L1 support and troubleshooting when 
needed and also on call .
- **Locally (Egypt)**
As a team we work on installing monitoring systems and launching web servers and databases 
recently working on installing Zabbix monitoring server ,publishing a website using Nginx and 
database server using PostgreSQL as well as Hardening for more secured servers

**Operations Engineer @ Link-Data Center (LDC) (_Aug 2022)**
- Worked mostly with hardware on premises with Servers ,Firewalls …etc , making sure all IT systems 
that we support is supporting businesses systems effectively ,also worked on updating software’s 
when needed , also moving servers in less then 5 mins between racks making sure customers 
business working 24*7 while working shifts monitoring all types of systems 

**Customer Support agent @ Vodafone UK (_March 2020 - 2020)**
- Helping customers with common issues with their network, dongles, modems and even their phones 
sometimes as per documentation for troubleshooting and handling daily tasks and It got me more 
experience in multitasking and documentation 

**IT HELP-DISK & ACCOUNTANT ASSISTANCE @ KING-MARIOUT MOTEL (_2016 - 2020 Summers)**
- Created a desktop software for calculating lost hours and overtime for staff getting data from 
fingerprint sensor, provided help in network maintenance (cameras, printers, PCs …etc.)


## CERTIFICATIONS
### Certified as Red Hat System Administrator (RHCSA)
[validation_link](https://rhtapps.redhat.com/verify?certId=220-129-894) ![redhat](/assets/img/redhat.png)

Developed objective strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra using **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed the more commonly used band boundaries by a factor of two. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and possibly discovering new indices of brain activity.

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
